# s2l-s2d
This repository contains the code of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01415) "Learning Landmarks motion from Speech for Speaker-Agnostic 3D Talking Heads Generation".
In this paper we propose a novel approach, based on landmarks motion, for generating 3D Talking Heads from speech. In this repo we insert the code for training the 2 models proposed in the paper S2L and S2D.
